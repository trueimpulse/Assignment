## Use Case:

The application facilitates the creation and storage of contacts via its frontend interface. Additionally, it offers seamless synchronization with existing contacts stored on HubSpot CRM. This integration ensures that updates made to contacts directly within the HubSpot CRM reflect instantaneously within the application's frontend interface upon initiating the synchronization process through the designated "Sync with HubSpot" button.
